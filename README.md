# Cardiology clinic

A Delphi project for a cardiology clinic, developed in collaboration with [Saulo Rodrigues](https://github.com/Saulogr/). The physician in charge can calculate how risky it is for the patient to undergo surgery and cardiac arrest based on personal information, such as gender, age, family history and so on.

The system is based on four different cardiac risk assessment, the first one being responsible for informing cardiac arrest chances, while the other three ouput pre-operation risk, according to the following chosen RCRI methods:

* Lee
* Goldman
* American College of Physicians (ACP)

I was in charge of the database, so I provided both a Microsoft Access version and a MySQL version of the database.
